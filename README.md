Get rid of File Explorer clutter in Windows 11, use this simple utility to quickly open a new tab instead of a new window in File Explorer, when you press `Win + E`.

`Win + E` before:

`Win + E` after:

If no File Explorer window is open, it will create a new one in the normal way.

**Note**: The Tabs feature for File Explorer is only available in Windows 11 22H2 Stable Build (22621) or later.
